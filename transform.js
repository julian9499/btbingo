`my internet lost connection
someone talks while muted
can you hear me
someone is too late
accidental noise
how does screen sharing works
roommate walks in
screen freezes
someones cat walks in front of the camera
awkward waving
hear someone typing
someone says vo on bt
julians camera is black and white
guus freezes
the video a company wants to show doesnt work
‘breakout rooms are opened’
someone yawns on camera
‘i am unable to enter the room’
kilian has a question
somebody eats in front of the camera
somebody makes a corona joke
people are sitting together behind their camera
somebody drinks from the adyen water bottle
somebody drinks from the BT coffe cup
